# CycleGAN-CBCT_to_CT
This project uses a CycleGAN-based architecture to perform unpaired image-to-image translation from Cone Beam CT (CBCT) images to standard CT images.  
It is designed for medical image preprocessing and domain adaptation in radiotherapy.  

## Download Dataset
This project uses the CBCT Liver and Liver Tumor Segmentation Train/Test Data dataset available on Kaggle.  
You can download it manually from Kaggle at the following link:

ðŸ”— [CBCT Liver and Liver Tumor Segmentation Train Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maximiliantschuchnig/cbct-liver-and-liver-tumor-segmentation-train-data)  
ðŸ”— [CBCT Liver and Liver Tumor Segmentation Test Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maximiliantschuchnig/cbct-liver-and-liver-tumor-segmentation-test-data)

## Dataset Pre-processing
To convert 3D CBCT/CT volumes (`.nii`) into 2D images for training, run the data_preprocessing.py  
ðŸ“Œ Note:
Replace input_dir and output_dir with the actual paths where your CBCT/CT data is stored and where you want the 2D images to be saved.

## Dataset Structure
After preprocessing, the CBCT and CT data are organized into a folder structure compatible with CycleGAN training:
'''
simple_cbct_ct_32/
â”œâ”€â”€ trainA/ # CBCT training images
â”œâ”€â”€ trainB/ # CT training images
â”œâ”€â”€ valA/ # CBCT validation images
â”œâ”€â”€ valB/ # CT validation images
â”œâ”€â”€ testA/ # CBCT test images
â””â”€â”€ testB/ # CT test images
'''
ðŸ“Œ Note:
All images are 2D grayscale .jpg slices. 
A = CBCT, B = CT for all folders.
