# CycleGAN-CBCT_to_CT
This project uses a CycleGAN-based architecture to perform unpaired image-to-image translation from Cone Beam CT (CBCT) images to standard CT images.  
It is designed for medical image preprocessing and domain adaptation in radiotherapy.  

## Installation

- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SunYujun0725/CycleGAN-CBCT_to_CT
cd CycleGAN-CBCT_to_CT
```

- Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) and 0.4+ and other dependencies (e.g., torchvision, [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) and [dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate)).
  - For pip users, please type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - For Conda users, you can create a new Conda environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
  - For Docker users, we provide the pre-built Docker image and Dockerfile. Please refer to our [Docker](docs/docker.md) page.
  - For Repl users, please click [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)](https://repl.it/github/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix).


## Download Dataset
This project uses the CBCT Liver and Liver Tumor Segmentation Train/Test Data dataset available on Kaggle.  
You can download it manually from Kaggle at the following link:

ðŸ”— [CBCT Liver and Liver Tumor Segmentation Train Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maximiliantschuchnig/cbct-liver-and-liver-tumor-segmentation-train-data)  
ðŸ”— [CBCT Liver and Liver Tumor Segmentation Test Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maximiliantschuchnig/cbct-liver-and-liver-tumor-segmentation-test-data)

## Dataset Pre-processing
To convert 3D CBCT/CT volumes (`.nii`) into 2D images for training, run the data_preprocess.py  
```bash
python data_preprocess.py
```
ðŸ“Œ Note: Replace input_dir and output_dir with the actual paths where your CBCT/CT data is stored and where you want the 2D images to be saved.

## Dataset Structure
After preprocessing, the CBCT and CT data are organized into a folder structure compatible with CycleGAN training:
```
cbct_ct/
â”œâ”€â”€ trainA/   # CBCT training images
â”œâ”€â”€ trainB/   # CT training images
â”œâ”€â”€ valA/     # CBCT validation images
â”œâ”€â”€ valB/     # CT validation images
â”œâ”€â”€ testA/    # CBCT test images
â””â”€â”€ testB/    # CT test images
```
ðŸ“Œ Note: All images are 2D grayscale .jpg slices. 

## train/test model
- Train a model:
```bash
#!./scripts/train_cyclegan.sh
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/cbct_ct --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan
```
To see more intermediate results, check out `./checkpoints/maps_cyclegan/web/index.html`.
- Test the model:
```bash
#!./scripts/test_cyclegan.sh
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/cbct_ct --name maps_cyclegan --model cycle_gan
```
- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/maps_cyclegan/latest_test/index.html`.
  
## Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the quality of the generated CT images, we provide a script `metric.py` to compute standard image similarity metrics including:

- **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
- **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index)
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)

Usage:  
Run the evaluation script after inference:
```bash
python metric.py
```
ðŸ“Œ Note:
Before running, make sure to update the image_dir path in metric.py to point to your result folder

## More Information

This project is based on the official [pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) implementation.
